### Overview
Using JavaScript to manipulate prompts, confirms and alerts to generate and produce a randomly generated password based off criteria that the user selects.

### Explanation of task
While you wouldn't normally use more than one prompt or alert on a page, this project focused solely on using prompts, alerts and confirms to query the user through a series of choices. The choices that the user selects will ultimately decide how many and the type of characters that will be used to choose from.  

### Benefit of password generator
In today's vast digital world it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep personal information and financial transactions secure.  Having a strong password is very important in maintaining that security.  This password generator will choose random characters which will make the password itself far more difficult to guess.
