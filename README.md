### Overview
Using JavaScript to manipulate prompts, confirms and alerts to generate and produce a randomly generated password based off criteria that the user selects.

### Explanation of task
While you wouldn't normally use more than one prompt or alert on a page, this project focused solely on using prompts, alerts and confirms to query the user through a series of choices. The choices that the user selects will ultimately decide how many and the type of characters that will be used to choose from.  

### Benefit of password generator
In today's vast digital world it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep personal information and financial transactions secure.  Having a strong password is very important in maintaining that security.  This password generator will choose random characters which will make the password itself far more difficult to guess.    

### Personal benefit from building this project

This project helped me to learn how to manipulate prompts, confirms and alerts to convey a message or ask for a response from the user.  in building this project I became far more familiar with IF/ELSE statements. I have a much better understanding now of how to use arrays and the Math.random function.  This was a project that seemed simple in nature but really held a wealth of learning opportunites for me. I am both very glad to have accomplished this task and also look forwrad to making it better in the future.
